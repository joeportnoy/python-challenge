The logic of PyPoll is this:

I need to count the candidate votes
I have 3 columns [0 - Ballot ID][1 - County][2 - Candidate]

I don't need the first two columns.

I need to cast the third column as an integer to capture the number of votes that candidate received.

I need to calculate the percentage of the total votes. I need to capture the number of total votes.

I need to also capture the name of every candidate that received a vote

Variable as I see them:

Total votes
